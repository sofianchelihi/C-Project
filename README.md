# üè¶ Bank Account Management System in C


## Project Overview

This **Bank Account Management System** is designed to simulate bank transactions such as handling account balances and processing transfers. Built in **C**, the project involves reading and updating binary and text files to reflect bank account activities efficiently. The project demonstrates key concepts like file handling, data structures, and optimization for handling large datasets.

## Features

- üèõ Manage CCP accounts and balances stored in binary files
- üîÑ Process transactions from a text file, applying the changes to account balances
- üßπ Remove duplicate CCP account entries during initialization
- üßæ Track accounts with negative balances and those exceeding 1,000,000 DZD
- üíæ Supports two file structures:
  - **TOF (Table Ordonn√©e Fixe)** for fixed-size records
  - **LOVC (Liste Ordonn√©e √† Variables Chevauchantes)** for variable-size records

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** C
- **File Types:**
  - Binary (`CCP_SOLDE.bin`, `CCP_SOLDE_2.bin`)
  - Text (`VIREMENTS.txt`)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Random number generation
  - Binary and text file manipulation
  - Dynamic memory management

## Installation

To compile and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sofianchelihi/C-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd C-Project
    ```

3. Compile the C source files using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

    ```bash
    gcc -o bank_management bank_management.c
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./bank_management
    ```

## Usage

- **CCP_SOLDE.bin:** Contains CCP account numbers and their balances.
- **VIREMENTS.txt:** Contains bank transfer records to be applied to CCP accounts.
- **CCP_SOLDE_2.bin:** An advanced file format with variable record size for handling transactions more efficiently.
  
### Key Operations:
- **Create** a binary file with random CCP accounts.
- **Process** bank transfers from the `VIREMENTS.txt` file.
- **Insert**, **delete**, or **update** records in the CCP account files.
- **View** all accounts with negative balances or those exceeding 1,000,000 DZD.
